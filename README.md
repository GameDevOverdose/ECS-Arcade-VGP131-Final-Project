# VGP131-Final Project 👨‍💻

Hey Guys! __Ayush Vaibhav Goyal__ (GameDevOverdose) here.



# Background 🖼️

I am currently studying in LaSalle College Vancouver for a Bachelor's in Game Programming and with the end of our 3rd Quarter coming close, as our final project, we were tasked by our Object-Oriented Programming In C++ II (VGP131) Professor [Amir Jahanlou](https://github.com/AmirJahan), to create an ECS (Entity Component System) based Game Engine and make a game in it to represent the engine's capability. We were given 3 weeks for the project (though I only ended up really working on it in the last 2 weeks), and once I was done with a basic implementation of my ECS, I started brainstorming about the game that I'll be making.

I thought what would be better to represent the versatility and the modularity of the Game Engine than to make 4 different games in it! So that's what I did.



# 🕹️ ECS Arcade 👾

The Game ECS Arcade combines 4 relatively different games, mechanics and systems into a single cohesive experience, representing the versatility of the ECS engine technically and also metaphorically through its story giving a glimpse into a slice of Video Game History when arcade machines were no longer bound to a single video game but rather could be reprogrammed and repurposed to play something else which I find to be quite similar to ECS's impact on the gaming industry through it's extremely modularized structure that allows games of all kind to be built in a single engine in a way that's efficient, performant and simple to use. Through this project, our professor __Amir__, not only wanted us to get on grips with the ECS Paradigm but also appreciate the architecture of it, and even though I may or may not have a deeper understanding of it I definitely do have respect for it after this project.



# How to Run 💻

Right now the only way to run the game is to download the Source Code and run it through an IDE but I am working on a way to upload an EXE of it right onto the GitHub repository. This is my first repository on GitHub so forgive me if few things feel messy.
